## Pong!

A super basic **Pong** game in Raylib & C++23.<br>
I initially wrote it whilst learning Raylib and C++, I brushed it up a bit using a cleaner architechture, 
using virtual classes & unique pointers rather than having different game loops for different scenes.<br>

### TODO:

Try to upload a small WASM demo using emscripten.
